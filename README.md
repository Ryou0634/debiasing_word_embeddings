# Debiasing Word Embeddings

This repository contains a notebook to reproduce some results in the paper [Man is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6228-man-is-to-computer-programmer-as-woman-is-to-homemaker-debiasing-word-embeddings.pdf) (the authors have already made their code available [here](https://github.com/tolga-b/debiaswe)).
The notebook is organized roughly based on the sections in the paper. Hope you will find it useful!
